  <p><span class="w3-xlarge">Fort Canning Park</span> an iconic hilltop
  landmark has witnessed many of Singapore’s historical milestones. The hill
  once sited the palaces of 14th century Kings and served as the Headquarters
  of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks. The decision to 
  surrender Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 was also made on
  the hill, in the Underground Far East Command Centre, commonly known as
  Battle Box.</p>
  <br>
  The park was originally known as Bukit Larangan, or 'Forbidden Hill' in
  Malay. Today, the 18-hectare space is chock full of attractions—from ancient
  artefacts for history buffs to outdoor lawns for concerts, and of course,
  greenery for nature lovers.
  <br>
  Today, Fort Canning Park features nine historical gardens - the Pancur Larangan, Artisan’s Garden, Sang Nila Utama Garden, Jubilee Park (Phase 1), Raffles Garden, First Botanic Garden, Farquhar Garden, Spice Garden and Armenian Street Park.

  <p>The Sang Nila Utama Garden, named after the Palembang prince, is a re-creation of South-east Asian gardens
  of the 14th century. Visitors are welcomed by Javanese split gates and
  statues of frogs, fish and ducks - fauna that was believed to be seen in the
  palace gardens. </p>

  <p> Keramat Iskandar Shah is commonly believed to be the final resting ground
  of Sultan Iskandar Shah. Originally a Hindu who went by the name of
  Parameswara, he converted to Islam and adopted this name when he married
  a Princess of Pasai in Malacca.

Sultan Iskandar Shah is portrayed as the last of the five kings to rule over
 Singapore in the 14th century and also the descendent of Sang Nila Utama,
 who we all know as the founder of Singapura</p>
